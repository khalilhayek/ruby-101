# Let's write a little program:
# Ask "what's your name?"
# Read from the keyboard.
# Print "Hello" followed by the name followed by !
# For example:
# What's your name?
# Bunbuns
# Hello Bunbuns!

# Try to write it on your own. 
# I have written below, way below, one solution. 
# But don't scroll down before trying to solve it yourself first.


























print "What's your name? "
name = gets.chomp
print "Hello ", name, "!\n"
