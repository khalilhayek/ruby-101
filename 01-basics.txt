These are different kinds of "constants". 
Integers:
3
0
-2

Real numbers, also called floating number, floats, decimals:
5.5
1.0
-100.4
0.23

Characters:
'c'
"D"
" "

Strings: a string is a sequence of characters:
"hello there!"
'Bye now!'

Characters and strings must be between quotes or double quotes.
But:
"This is not a string'
Spot the problem?

Logical (Boolean) constants:
true
false

The nothing constant:
nil

Now let's look at lists:

This is an array of integers:
[1,2,3,4,5]

This is an array of Logical values:
[true, true, false, true, false]

This is an array of strings:
['Bunbuns', 'Rusty', 'Datschie', 'Affe']

This is an array of different things:
['Bunbuns', 100, 'Affe', false, 10.5123]

This is the range of numbers from 1 to 5:
(1..5)

This is the range of characters from 'e' to 'k':
('e'..'k')
