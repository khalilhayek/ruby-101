OK, now you know about values, variables, and constants, and you know how to form variable names and constant names.

Variable names:
name, bunnys_name, bunnysName, number_1_food, foodNumber1

Constant names:
COLOR_ORANGE
NUM_1_FOOD
FOOD1

Later on you will find modules and classes. Their names must start with a capital letter, followed by small letters, numbers or underscores.
The following are common class names:
Object
String
Array
Exception

Don't worry about these for now. We'll get to them later.
