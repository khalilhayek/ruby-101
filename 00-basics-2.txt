As an example, consider of the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Setup:
You have a game board with 9 cells arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns.
All the cells are blank.
One player has symbol X, the other has symbol O.
First player is Player X.

Repeat this:
1. Display the board.
2. Player marks one empty cell.
3. If any row or column or diagonal contains all this player's mark, 
   this player wins, the game ends.
4. If all cells are marked by X or O, it's a tie, the game ends.
5. The next round is for the other player.
