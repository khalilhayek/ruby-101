Computer programming is a mental exercise.
Before you touch the keyboard to start writing a program, you have to 
solve the problem in your head:

Identify the problem that you need to solve. 
Identify the relevant information (data) that you are given,
and the unknowns that you need to compute. 
Figure out a method to solve the problem, an algorithm.

Your algorithm will consist of different steps.
Some steps include making decisions: 
	if some condition is true, then do some action
	but if another condition is true, then do another action.
Some steps include repetition:
	either stepping through the elements of a list,
	or repeating a process until some condition is met.
Some steps involve transforming data, either by arithmetic
operations, text manipulation, computations, etc.

Once you have the algorithm, you can start writing it
in a computer langauge. 
Or you can implement it with pencil and paper.

As you develop the algorithm and then the program, think about
your data and the most suitable way to represent it.
Your data may be:
	integer numbers,
	real numbers,
	words and sentences,
	logical values (true, false),
	dictionaries (name: value, name: value, ...),
	or lists of any of the above.

Understanding your data and representing it correctly helps
keep the algorithm simple and legible.
