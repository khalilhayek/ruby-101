I was looking for a tutorial to introduce programming to teen age children.
Most of what I found online was either too elementary, aimed at young children, or
a bit too complicated for teenagers with 0 programming experience.
So I decided to write one. 
I chose to do it in Ruby because it's syntax is simple, clear and forgiving (no need to worry about indentation, for example).
This is a sequence of about 20 modules (I'll upload the rest later) culminating in programming a few games and mathematical challenges.
Along the way, it explains basic concepts in computer science (control flow, scope, typing, encapsulation, ...) in a simple way, without going too technical.
